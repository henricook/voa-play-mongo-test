# VOA Play/Mongo Assessment - Henri Cook

# About me

Thanks for considering this test. I'm a contractor already working within HMRC with Scala/Mongo/Play so have extensive experience with the MDTP. 
I believe the VOA is linked with the tax/MDTP ecosystem which means you can checkout my work to date from within the organisation (@henri-cook on internal github) or
by looking at my current team's open source contributions (@henricook on github.com) under the HMRC organisation.

You can also contact me on hmrcdigital slack, @henri.cook

# To Run

    sbt run

# About the test

This was implemented in around an hour and a half.

## Structure

- Controllers
- Repositories (DAL)
- Services (Logic abstraction from controllers)
- Connectors (Adapters for third part services)

Run integration tests with

    sbt it:test

Run unit tests with

    sbt test

## Base

I contemplated using HMRC's Play2.5 template for this (https://github.com/hmrc/example-play-25-microservice) as it would have been more like "real life" as an MDTP citizen. In the end however i've opted for a vanilla play2.5 template (via activator) to keep the code free from any unnecessary complexity. HMRC's Play2.5 template is also relatively new, and still generates some compile warnings due to the need to be backwards compatible.

## Future improvements

Items that could be included in future work:

- Introduce custom configuration parameters
- Indexes/uniqueness constraints on the mongo collection 
- Client side validation (if dictated by requirements)
- Removing the use of flashing() for transmitting names to the success view (could be unreliable)
- Base template for views for DRY
- Use more complex types for storage (if needed by requirements, e.g. storing more than just a country code)
- Use enums to express sex/gender


## Scaling

Of course in a real deployment where scale was a concern, this would be split into at least frontend and backend micro services, if not eventually several domain-oriented
backend microservices.

## Architecture

For such a straightforward spec, I could legitimately be accused of overengineering this solution. I've tried to use repository, service and connector patterns to 
demonstrate my knowledge. But if this spec was the entire scope of the project it's likely I would have done much more within the ApplicationController.

I would not normally call repositories directly from a controller as I have here, i'd insert an interim service, in my experience that helps testability.

## External Dependencies

As required i've used the restcountries.eu endpoint for Europe data, in a real world situation I wouldn't have depended on this third party unless it was a firm
requirement to do so, i would more likely have kept a copy for the application locally where it could be accessed quickly and reliably, and refreshed it as necessary.

# Replay of Requirements

Please complete the following problem to determine your competency with Scala
and Play. Use Scala, Play and MongoDB. Place your final solution in a GitHub
repository. Provide a readme that explains how you have implemented your solution
and how to execute it. Provide the GitHub repository name to your recruitment
contact on completion.

Requirements:

1. Create a web application that allows a user to enter the details shown in the
screen mockups below.

2. Use the json endpoint https://restcountries.eu/rest/v1/region/Europe to populate
the Country drop down.

3. Validate all user input. All inputs are mandatory. Display an appropriate error
message when invalid data is entered.

4. Display the userâ€™s name in the message shown on the second page.

5. Save the validated data to a MongoDB collection. The MongoDB database name
should be nodetest and the collection name should be userdata. The document
properties should be name, sex, age, country and dateCreated.

6. Write tests that test the retrieval of country data and your persistence mechanism.
